## Code review

### Reviewer (maintainer)

**Overall:** Request changes until tests land.

| Area            | Comment |
|-----------------|--------|
| Correctness     | Logic matches stated intent; edge cases called out in tests. |
| Security        | Check auth/signers, reentrancy, integer bounds, and RPC trust boundaries. |
| Performance     | Acceptable for target chain; note any hot paths. |
| Observability   | Logs/metrics sufficient to debug production failures. |
| Docs            | README or inline notes updated for operators/devs. |

### Inline-style notes (simulated)

1. **@reviewer:** Please add a negative test for the failure path.  
   **@author:** Added in commit follow-up; see test case `handles invalid input`.

2. **@reviewer:** Consider naming: `x` → something domain-specific.  
   **@author:** Renamed for clarity.

3. **@reviewer:** Are we sure this invariant holds after reorgs?  
   **@author:** Documented limitation; indexer rewinds N blocks (see PR description).
